# Web Static Directory

This directory contains all the static files for the web application. These files include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets that are served directly to the user's browser.

## Directory Structure

The `web_static` directory has the following structure:

- `css/`: This directory contains all the CSS files that style the web pages.
- `js/`: This directory contains all the JavaScript files that add interactivity to the web pages.
- `images/`: This directory contains all the image files used in the web pages.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that is served when a user visits the site.

## Usage

To use the files in this directory, simply point your web server to serve files from this directory. For example, if you're using a simple Python server, you can start it in this directory with the command `python -m http.server`.
